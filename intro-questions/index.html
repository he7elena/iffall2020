        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <h2>1. Provide you name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Elena He! I'm a senior this year majoring in Marketing and minoring in Design and Business of Art.</p>
        <h2>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</h2>
        <p>I primarily want to go into advertising design and want to learn from this class how to potentially make my own website to host my digital portfolio. I also have a little bit of UI design experience that made me interested in learning more about creating user-friendly platforms.</p>
        <h2>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</h2>
        <p>I have very minimal experience with HTML - I taught myself some basics a couple summers ago. I have absolutely no experience with CSS or JS.</p>
        <h2>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h2>
        <p>I know the basic purposes of HTML and CSS, but I would like to learn what I can create with JS.</p>
        <h2>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h2>
        <p>Designing for screen takes more steps between the act of creation and the product. On the other hand, you can visually see what you create as you make it on paper.</p>
        <h2>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.pictureofhotdog.com/">Hot Dog</a>Considering the nature of this website as a developing joke, I think it's especially effective that it has a simple design. This helps to highlight rather than detract from the content of each page that is meant to elicit a couple laughs.</p>
        <h2>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/">Think with Google</a>This is one of Google's key marketing research and insights websites, and I think its communication is effective particularly because the design divides up the wealth of technical information in a way that makes the content easier to digest.</p>
        <h2>8.Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>For a website whose purpose is to help users who have little to no web design experience to create effective and well-designed websites, Wix does a great job in keeping its layouts and functions simple for the average user. I have personally created several websites using Wix and have found it to be the most user-friendly compared to its major competitors like Squarespace, Weebly, and WordPress.</p>
